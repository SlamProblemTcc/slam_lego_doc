 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}

   Most of the researches related to robotics mainly focus on the mobility of the robot. That happens because of the need for navegation
   and self localization in the environment in most of the activities. For this purpose, the technique of SLAM
   ( Simultaneous-localization and mapping) has been developed in various contexts in all robotics communities.
